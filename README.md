# alphabet_book
Mobile App for toddlers to scroll through the English alphabet. The app was based on the Flutter Challenge at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syd0c9Vi2hg. I modified it to fit the needs of a simple app for my son. I also made a small change to the page_indicator.dart file to accommodate a larger number of pages.

Thanks to Fluttery for the foundation of the app.
Thanks to Collin Jackson for the change needed for the ListView: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46222788/how-to-create-a-row-of-scrollable-text-boxes-or-widgets-in-flutter-inside-a-list/46245548#46245548
