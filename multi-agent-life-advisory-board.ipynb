Ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in Kaggle Secrets for Gemini LLM.\n2. **Configuration**: Adjust `CONFIG` below to toggle evaluation (`ENABLE_EVALUATION`), swap LLMs (`MODEL_CONFIG`), and customize behavior.\n3. **Run**: Execute the notebook to start the chat. Type goals or questions, rate advice if enabled, and use 'q' to quit and see/download ratings.\n4. **Download Ratings**: After quitting, run the download cell to access `ratings.json`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Use the API\n\nStart by installing and importing the Gemini API Python SDK.\n\nOccasionally, this block throws a pip warning on the 1st run.

Let's also discuss your timeframe \\u2013 when do you plan to buy the car?\",\n      \"6 months from now\",\n      \"Money Advisor (MA):  Six months to save $119,700 is very ambitious. That's roughly $19,950 per month.  To achieve this, you'll need to drastically increase your savings rate and potentially explore alternative financing options like a car loan. Can you provide your monthly income and expenses so we can assess your savings potential?  We might also need to look at higher-yield savings accounts or investment options to accelerate your savings, but those carry risk.  Let's discuss your financial situation in more detail.\",\n      \"I earn about $600/month now.

Saving $119,700 in six months requires saving almost $20,000 per month, which is far beyond your current capacity.  To realistically save for a $120,000 car in six months, you'll need to significantly increase your income or extend your savings timeframe.  Have you considered exploring options to increase your income, such as a part-time job or freelance work?  Alternatively, you might need to reconsider your car choice and aim for a less expensive vehicle.  Let's discuss both options.\",\n      \"ok\",\n      \"Money Advisor (MA):  To explore increasing your income, what skills do you possess that could be monetized through part-time work or freelancing?

While it might seem like a quick way to increase income, it\\u2019s crucial to consider the long-term implications and potential dangers.  There are safer and more sustainable ways to increase your income, such as developing marketable skills and seeking legitimate employment opportunities.  Have you considered exploring other avenues for income generation, such as online freelancing, part-time jobs, or improving your current job to increase your earnings?\",\n      \"What about onlyfans?\",\n      \"Money Advisor (MA): OnlyFans can be a source of income, but it also carries risks and potential downsides.  It requires a significant time investment to build a following and generate substantial income, and success isn't guaranteed.  There are also potential legal and ethical considerations, depending on the content you create.  Before pursuing this route, I strongly advise you to carefully research the platform's terms of service, understand the legal and tax implications, and consider the potential impact on your personal safety and reputation.  Have you considered alternative income-generating options that might be less risky and more sustainable in the long term?

To help you develop a plan, let's discuss your photography style, target audience, and pricing strategy.  What kind of photography are you most skilled in, and what's your ideal hourly or per-project rate?  We can then create a realistic plan to increase your income to support your car purchase goal, or adjust your car purchase goal to be more realistic within your current income capabilities.\",\n      \"Bird photography.

Let's break down the steps to build your subscriber base and achieve your monthly income target.

Knowing this will help us determine your actual profit margin.\",\n      \" I can acquire at least 200 subscribers\",\n      \"Money Advisor (MA): With 200 subscribers at a $500/month subscription, you'd earn $100,000 in six months. That's significantly more than your initial goal of $119,700 needed for the $120,000 car.  However, let's factor in potential costs. What are your estimated monthly expenses for running your bird photography business (website hosting, equipment maintenance, marketing, etc.)?  Knowing this will help us determine your net profit and adjust your savings plan accordingly.  We can then discuss strategies to manage and reinvest profits to further grow your business and ensure its long-term sustainability.\",\n      \"I think Costs would be around $2000/month. But can you estimate these items for me?\",\n      \"Money Advisor (MA): Certainly.  Let's break down potential monthly costs for your bird photography business:\\n\\n* **Website Hosting:**  Depending on the platform and features, this could range from $10-$100/month.  A basic plan might suffice initially.\\n* **Equipment Maintenance:** This is variable and depends on your equipment. Factor in potential repairs, cleaning, or upgrades.  Let's estimate $50-$100/month for now, but this could be higher.\\n* **Marketing & Advertising:** This is crucial for attracting subscribers.  Consider costs for social media advertising, website promotion, or potential collaborations.  Let's estimate $500-$1000/month initially, but this is highly variable and can be adjusted based on your strategy.\\n* **Software & Tools:**  You might need image editing software, business management tools, etc.  Let's estimate $50-$100/month.\\n\\n**Total Estimated Monthly Costs:**  Based on these estimates, your monthly costs could range from $710 to $1260.  This is lower than your $2000 estimate, but it's crucial to track your actual spending to refine this figure.  Remember, these are estimates, and your actual costs may vary.\\n\\n\\nNow, let's revisit your income.  With 200 subscribers at $500/month, your gross revenue is $100,000.  Subtracting your estimated monthly costs (let's use the higher estimate of $1260 for a conservative approach), your net profit over six months would be approximately $100,000 - ($1260 * 6) = $92,240. This is more than enough to cover the cost of your car.  However, it's essential to have a buffer for unexpected expenses and reinvest some profits back into your business for growth. We can discuss strategies for that as well.\",\n      \"let's finalize the plan\",\n      \"```json\\n{\\n  \\\"career\\\": {\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Start a bird photography subscription service\\\",\\n    \\\"actions\\\": [\\n      \\\"Develop a strong online presence (website, social media)\\\",\\n      \\\"Create high-quality bird photography content\\\",\\n      \\\"Implement a marketing strategy to attract subscribers\\\",\\n      \\\"Set competitive pricing\\\",\\n      \\\"Manage finances effectively, track expenses, and reinvest profits\\\"\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  \\\"money\\\": {\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Save $120,000 for a new car within six months\\\",\\n    \\\"actions\\\": [\\n      \\\"Start a bird photography subscription service\\\",\\n      \\\"Aim for at least 200 subscribers at $500/month\\\",\\n      \\\"Manage business expenses effectively (estimated at $1260/month)\\\",\\n      \\\"Reinvest profits to grow the business\\\",\\n      \\\"Consider alternative financing options if needed\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"financial_plan\\\": {\\n      \\\"income\\\": {\\n        \\\"source\\\": \\\"Bird Photography Subscription Service\\\",\\n        \\\"projected_monthly_income\\\": \\\"$100,000 (200 subscribers * $500/month)\\\",\\n        \\\"projected_annual_income\\\": \\\"$600,000\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"expenses\\\": {\\n        \\\"estimated_monthly_costs\\\": \\\"$1260\\\",\\n        \\\"estimated_annual_costs\\\": \\\"$15,120\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"net_profit\\\": {\\n        \\\"projected_six_month_profit\\\": \\\"$92,240\\\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \\\"combined\\\": {\\n    \\\"strategy\\\": \\\"Leverage photography skills to generate income exceeding the car purchase goal, thereby eliminating the need for extensive personal savings.\\\",\\n    \\\"timeline\\\": \\\"Six months\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"2024-07-26T16:41:00Z\\\"\\n}\\n```\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Next Steps\n* Add interactivity *[Done]*\n* Fix text cut-off issue in advisor responses *[Done]*\n* Feature: ability to use different LLM models for each advisor (both Gemini-1.5-flash, configurable) *[Done]*\n* Feature: ability to switch models easily in the code *[Done]*\n* Use @tool annotation for RAG instead of direct LLM calls *[Done]*\n* Switched back to Gemini LLM with updated versions *[Done]*\n* Updated initial message and system instructions *[Done]*\n* Fixed repeated invites and unclear speaker labels *[Done]*\n* Add evaluation section *[Done]*\n* Feature: ability switch models easily in the code\n* Polish for submission","metadata":{}}]}
